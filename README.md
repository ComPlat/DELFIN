# DELFIN

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17208145.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17208145)

**Automated DFT-based prediction of preferred spin states and associated redox potentials**

This repository contains DELFIN, a comprehensive workflow tool for automated quantum chemistry calculations using ORCA, xTB, and CREST. DELFIN automates the identification of preferred electron configurations, tracks orbital occupation changes during redox processes, and calculates redox potentials.

## ðŸš€ Quick Install

```bash
pip install delfin-complat
```

**Requirements:**
- **Python 3.10+**
- **ORCA 6.1.0** in your `PATH` ([free for academic use](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal))
- **Optional:** CREST, xTB (for extended workflows)

> **Prereqs**
>
> * ORCA **6.1.0** in your `PATH` (`orca` and `orca_pltvib`)
> * Optional: `crest` (for CREST workflow), **xTB** if used (`xtb` and `crest` in `PATH`)
> * Python **3.10+** required

## Install

**PyPI Package**: https://pypi.org/project/delfin-complat/

From the `delfin` folder (the one containing `pyproject.toml`):

recommended (isolated) install
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```
regular install
```bash
pip install delfin-complat
```

All Python dependencies (for example `mendeleev` for covalent radii) are installed automatically. Using a virtual environment or tools such as `pipx` keeps the scientific software stack reproducible and avoids system-wide modifications.

This exposes the console command **`delfin`** and enables `python -m delfin`.

## Quick start

Create a working directory with at least these two files:

* `CONTROL.txt` â€” your control/config file
* `input.txt` â€” the starting geometry (XYZ body without the first two header lines)
* starting from a `XYZ` file is optional

Then run:

from the directory that contains CONTROL.txt and input.txt
```bash
delfin
```
alternatively
```bash
python -m delfin
```

**CLI shortcuts**

- `delfin --define[=input.xyz] [--overwrite]`
  creates/updates `CONTROL.txt` and optionally converts an XYZ into `input.txt`.
- `delfin --control /path/to/CONTROL.txt`
  runs the workflow from another directory while normalising all paths.
- `delfin --no-cleanup`
  keeps temporary files and scratch folders after the pipeline finishes.
- `delfin --cleanup`
  removes previously generated intermediates and exits immediately.
- `delfin cleanup --orca`
  stops running ORCA jobs in the current workspace, purges OCCUPIER scratch folders, and cleans leftover temporary files.
- `delfin --purge`
  clears the working directory (keeps CONTROL.txt and the configured input file only) after confirmation.
- `delfin --recalc`
  re-parses existing results and only restarts missing or incomplete jobs.
- `delfin --help`
  prints the full list of CLI flags, including the new pipeline/resource switches.

Results and reports are written to the current working directory,
e.g. `DELFIN.txt`, `OCCUPIER.txt`, and per-step folders.

## Excited-State Dynamics (ESD) Module

> **Status:** The ESD module is under construction and not yet production-ready.

The optional ESD pipeline optimises S0/S1/T1/T2 states and launches intersystem
crossing (ISC) / internal conversion (IC) calculations inside a dedicated `ESD/`
folder. Enable it via `ESD_modul=yes` in `CONTROL.txt`. It runs after the normal
redox workflows when `method` is set, or on its own when `method` is left empty.

Minimal CONTROL settings:

```ini
ESD_modul=yes
states=S0,S1,T1,T2
ISCs=S1>T1,T1>S1
ICs=S1>S0
```

Geometries, GBW and Hessian files are staged under `ESD/` and reused automatically.
All states inherit the system charge and use multiplicity 1 (triplets employ UKS internally).

> Note: the %ESD `DELE` entry is currently omitted; ORCA falls back to its internal defaults.
> Temperature is still taken from `temperature` (defaults to 298.15 K).

Directory snapshot:

```
ESD/
  S0.inp/.out/.xyz/.gbw/.hess
  S1.inp/.out/.xyz/.gbw/.hess
  T1.inp/.out/.xyz/.gbw/.hess
  T2.inp/.out/.xyz/.gbw/.hess
  S1_T1_ISC.inp/.out
  ...

## Typical workflow switches (in CONTROL.txt)

* `method = OCCUPIER | classic | manually` (leave empty for ESD-only runs)
* `calc_initial = yes | no`
* `oxidation_steps = 1,2,3` (string; steps to compute)
* `reduction_steps = 1,2,3` (string; steps to compute)
* `E_00 = yes | no`
* `absorption_spec = yes | no`
* `parallel_workflows = yes | no | auto` (parallelization)
* `pal_jobs = N` (number of parallel PAL processes; auto-detected from cluster if not set)
* `orca_parallel_strategy = auto | threads | serial` (ORCA parallelization mode)
  - `auto` (default): Use MPI + OpenMP; FoBs run in parallel
  - `threads`: Use only OpenMP (no MPI); FoBs still run in parallel, useful if MPI is unstable
  - `serial`: Force sequential execution; only 1 FoB at a time
* `IMAG_scope = initial | all`
  - `initial` (default): only the initial geometry will run IMAG elimination.
  - `all`: the IMAG workflow is executed for all configured redox steps.
